# Portal Clone

A lightweight clone of the APIMatic portal....

## How it works

You will need your API keys of all the APIs

* Edit v/1_0 with your api key
* Edit/delete v/2_0 with your api key
* Update the default links in the index.html(landing page) to point to the latest page v/2_0 

Now you have a bare bones webpage with a seperate page for each version of your API
